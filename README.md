## About Me

I’m a researcher specializing in **human-centered AI** for improving **human learning experiences**, with interests spanning **computer vision**, **multimodal AI**, and **large language models (LLMs)**. I am completing my PhD at **NUS-ECE** under the supervision of **Dr. Mike Zheng Shou**, in collaboration with **Dr. Qianli Xu** at **A*STAR**.

My research focuses on building assistive AI systems that combine **multimodal feature modeling** and **LLM-powered reasoning** to enhance **human-in-the-loop** applications. With experience in **embedded systems** and **cognitive science**, I aim to bridge embedded intelligence with human-AI interaction.

## Research Experience

### PhD Candidate — Show Lab-NUS & I2R-A*STAR  
**Aug 2021 – Present · Singapore**  
*Supervised by Dr. Mike Zheng Shou and Dr. Qianli Xu*

- **PLUFFIN Framework:** Developed a holistic computational framework structuring multimodal procedural plans (MPPs), human-AI collaborative modeling, and retrieval-augmented mistake detection to support real-time human-centered learning from instructional videos.
- **VG-TVP and VG-MPP Models:** Designed models that process curated and raw instructional videos into structured, visually-grounded procedural plans, improving scalability and generalizability (up to **86% human preference rate**).
- **GazeVQA & AssistGaze:** Built an industrial, gaze-enhanced VideoQA dataset and a multimodal AI assistant integrating eye gaze and multimodal features (**≈40% improvement**).
- **RAMMP:** Created a retrieval-augmented multimodal mistake predictor for real-time semantic mistake detection and context-aware feedback generation (**≈5% above SOTA**).
